Before you run the project, make sure you have installed all of the modules, by typing this command in the client and server directory(Assuming you have installed node js):
### `npm i`

After that check if you have the file (.env) in the client folder. If not create it, with the contents like this:

### `REACT_APP_API=http://localhost:5000`

After that run in order - in server directory first, then in client directory second this command:

### `npm start`

This runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
